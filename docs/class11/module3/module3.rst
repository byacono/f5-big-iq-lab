Module 3: DDoS Monitoring and Dashboard
=======================================

Goal:

In this lab, we will generate attack traffic on a BIG-IP being managed 
by BIG-IQ 6.1 with DCDs. When BIG-IP is configured to send DoS logs to 
the DCD, BIG-IQ can display a near real time DoS Dashbaord for visibility 
and analysis.
