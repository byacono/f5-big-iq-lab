Module 1: Required Configuration For DDoS Monitoring
=====================================================

Goal:

In this lab, we will validate the required configuration of BIG-IQ for DDoS analytics and BIG-IP logging profiles. If the AFM 
lab module was completed, logging profiles will already exist in BIG-IQ and have been deployed to the BIG-IP. While we can reuse
some of these components and create a new profile ourselves, we will again use the BIG-IQ Log Profile generation in this lab.
