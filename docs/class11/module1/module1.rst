Module 1: Required Configuration For DDoS Monitoring
=====================================================

Goal:

In this lab, we will validate the required configuration of BIG-IQ for DDoS analytics and BIG-IP logging profiles. If the AFM 
lab module was completed, logging profiles will already exist in BIG-IQ and have been deployed to the BIG-IP. 

If this is the case the creation of the profile in lab 1 can be skipped however, we will apply additional settings and deploy
these settings for the DDoS Labs to provide local visibility of DoS events on the BIG-IP.
