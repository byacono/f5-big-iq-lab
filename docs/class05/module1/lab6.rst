------------------------------------------
``Ça arrive bientôt זה בקרוב Viene pronto すぐに来る Sta arrivando presto قادم قريبا Coming soon 即將到來``

Create and deploy/run scripts on the managed devices.
This area can be used for various purposes, including deploying or modifying BIG-IP configuration that is not natively manageable by the BIG-IQ
or running a standard device startup/provisioning script prior to import into BIG-IQ.
Scripts can be bash or TMSH commands.
