Lab 3.2: Execute a TMSH script from BIG-IQ
------------------------------------------

Create and deploy/run scripts on the managed devices.
This area can be used for various purposes, including deploying or modifying BIG-IP configuration that is not natively manageable by the BIG-IQ
or running a standard device startup/provisioning script prior to import into BIG-IQ.
Scripts can be bash or TMSH commands.
