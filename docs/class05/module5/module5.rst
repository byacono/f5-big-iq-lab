Module 5: License Management
============================
A software license is specific to F5 product services (for example, BIG-IP LTM, BIG-IP APM, and so forth), and is organized in a license pool.
From BIG-IQ Centralized Management, you can easily manage licenses in those pools for numerous devices.
That means you don't have to log in to each individual BIG-IP VE device to activate, revoke, or reassign a license.

After you activate your subscription or ELA registration key for a pool license from BIG-IQ, you can assign the license to a managed, 
or unmanaged, BIG-IP VE device. If you assign a license from a license pool to a BIG-IP device and later decide you don't need that device licensed, 
you can revoke the license and assign it to another BIG-IP VE device. This process is similar to a library, where you loan (assign) a 
license to a BIG-IP device when it is required, and check the license back into the license pool on BIG-IQ (revoke it from the device) so it is available 
to assign to another BIG-IP VE. This flexible licensing model helps keep track of the licenses, and manage your operating costs.

There are 3 types of devices you can manage licenses for:

- Managed BIG-IP devices: From BIG-IQ, you assign licenses to and revoke license from BIG-IP devices using each device’s SSL certificate for authentication over an SSL connection.
- Unmanaged BIG-IP devices: From BIG-IQ, you assign licenses to and revoke licenses from BIG-IP devices using each BIG-IP device’s IP address, user name, and password for authentication over an SSL connection.
- Unreachable devices: For devices that BIG-IQ does not have network access to, a third-party computer or program communicates with BIG-IQ through API calls to get a license from BIG-IQ and assign it to the BIG-IP device by a method of your choosing. The third party makes a similar API call to BIG-IQ for revoking a license. For more information about these API calls, see https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/big-iq/mgmt-api/v6.1.0/.
  
In this lab, we will see the difference between the various types of license pools and how to license a BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) using BIG-IQ as a License Manager.
