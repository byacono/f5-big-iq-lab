Class 7: Introduction
=====================

.. warning:: When using the UDF or Ravello Lab, make sure:

  1. STOP the ESXi if you do not plan to demo VMware SSG.
  2. STOP your deployment at the end of your demo.
  3. Do not forget to tear down your AWS & Azure SSG if any.
  4. In case of demonstrating VMware SSG, use only Arizona, Virginia or Frankfurt region to get good performance.

This class will be exploring using BIG-IQ to create, deploy, manage, and monitor Advanced Firewall Manager deployments.  The lab will create new firewall objects, deploy these objects to new application templates, and then use tools on the BIG-IQ to monitor and manage firewall policies.
