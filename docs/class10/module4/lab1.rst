Lab 4.1: GSLB analytics
-----------------------
This section of the lab is design to present an overview of the DNS statistics that are available in BIG-IQ. While not a complete customer scenario, the UDF environment is built to provide some DNS traffic in order to populate the charts and graphs.

For this lab, the student is not asked to create any configuration, but rather just explore the information available.

Navigate to *Monitoring* > *DNS* > *Overview* 
In this view, you can see a general view of DNS traffic. The panels on the right-hand side may be used to limit the view to a particular device, Listener, or Sync Group.
