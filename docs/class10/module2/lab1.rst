Lab 2.1: Creating a WIP for GSLB
---------------------------------
A wide IP maps a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to one or more pools of virtual servers that host the content of a domain. When an LDNS issues a DNS name resolution for a wide IP, the configuration of the wide IP indicates which pools of virtual servers are eligible to respond to the request, and which load balancing methods BIG-IP DNS uses to select the pool.
