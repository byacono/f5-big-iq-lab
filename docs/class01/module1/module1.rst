Module 1: Creating the personas (users with roles)
==================================================
In this module, we will learn about the different personas used in the Cloud Edition workflows.

We will use these personas through out the lab. We are not trying to demonstrate full RBAC feature, as this is not the focus.

.. note:: David, Marco, Paula, Paul and Larry are already created in the blueprint, so only the **olivia* user needs to be created.

We will be using 4 main personas for this lab:

1. **David** & **Marco**: Full Administrator
2. **Larry**: Security Manager
3. **Paula** & **Paul**: Application Manager
4. **Olivia**: Super-NetOps

**David** and **Marco** will have full access to BIG-IQ. He knows a lot about F5 products (BIG-IQ/BIG-IP).
He will provide the access to David, Larry and Paula. He will also manage the Service Scaling Group (SSG)
and application templates.

**Larry** will manage the Web Application Firewall (WAF) policies. He will work with Paula's team
to define the necessary security policies for each applications.
Ensure teams comply with security policies, industry rules and regulations, and best practices.
Keeping up to date on threats, determining their potential impact, and mitigating the risks.

**Paula** and **Paul** will manage the application deployments, monitor levels of app incidents, building solutions to address identified, prioritized business problems in a timely manner.
Maximizing value of app through capabilities design, adoption, and usage.
Ensuring that the app fits within the rest of the organizationâ€™s app portfolio strategy.

**Olivia** will try automating whenever possible, to enable efficiency and ability to solve problems at scale.
Automate common network patterns that the other teams can consume.
Automate existing environment management and troubleshooting tasks.
